/*  Write a program that uses a SinglyLinkedList that gets populated by prime numbers from 0 to n. 
    Then move the prime numbers that has the digit '3' into another linked list. 
    After that find the sum of numbers in the second list.  (n should be less than 1,000,000).
    For example, the sum of the prime numbers (with 3 digit) between 0 and n=100 is (3+ 13+  23+ 31+ 37+ 43+  53+73+83 )= 359.
